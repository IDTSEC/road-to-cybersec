## 📌 Why Cybersecurity?
After years working on a Microsoft project with Majorel (now Teleperformance), I’ve fully committed to cybersecurity. Throughout my time in resource management, I handled urgent technical requests, supported onboarding, matched engineers to high-stakes projects and worked closely with delivery managers -- even supporting cybersecurity-related roles and escalations. That exposure lit the spark.  
I love solving complex problems, thinking critically under pressure and - most of all - defending people and systems. I'm especially passionate about the blue team side of security.

## 📍 Goal
Grow into a strong cybersecurity analyst & more. My dream is to work in security and build something meaningful there.
