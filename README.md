## 📌 Why Cybersecurity?
Throughout my time in resource management with Microsoft, I handled urgent technical requests, supported onboarding, matched engineers to high-stakes projects and worked closely with delivery managers -- even supporting cybersecurity-related roles and escalations. That exposure lit the spark.  
I love solving complex problems, thinking critically under pressure and - most of all - defending people and systems. I'm especially passionate about the blue team side of security.

## 📍 Goal
To grow into a skilled cybersecurity analyst, specializing in areas like SOC operations, vulnerability assessment, and IT security. I want to contribute meaningfully to the security of people and orgs.
